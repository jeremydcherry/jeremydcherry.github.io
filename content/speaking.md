### Talking design with other humans

---

![Jeremy D. Cherry speaking at an event](/images/speaking-img.jpg)

I’ve had the distinct honor of teaching design ethics and theory to folks all over the world. My experience as a speaker and educator covers a wide range of settings and topics. I’ve spoken to classrooms in public universities, community colleges, and an international school in Taiwan. I’ve had the privilege of speaking at events and conferences, including Tom Tom Festival, Ignite UX Michigan, edUI, and Creative Mornings. Finally, I’ve worked with teams of fellow designers, including the talented folks at Spotify, WillowTree, and VMDO Architects, to find ways to incorporate ethics into professional communities. Whether it be delivering keynote speeches or leading practice-based workshops, I get so much life from connecting with others through this work.

#### [Expertise](#expertise):

My favorite topic to speak about is how hope impacts the work we create for other humans. I’m generally skeptical of big tech because of how it can treat humans like data points that solely impact profit margins. I firmly believe that with the power of emerging technology comes an increased responsibility to those engaging with our work. However, I’m confident that if designers learn to embrace people with hope and lean into the complexity of working with others, we could change the products we create for the better.
