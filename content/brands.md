#### Manifesto:

<span class="manifesto">A brand is only as good as the <em>human</em> endeavor it represents. Meaningful brands transmit value, dignify participants, portray products and services authentically, reduce waste, clarify confusion, and conveys our highest ideals.</span>

#### Tenets:

## 01. Represent Humans
Brands must be ecological, reflecting who they represent.

## 02. Transmit Value
Brands must be useful, being both helpful and beautiful.

## 03. Dignify Viewers
Brands must be thoughtful, providing meaning to communities.

## 04. Portray Authenticity
Brands must be honest, echoing human aspirations.

## 05. Reduce Waste
Brands must be responsible, being mindful of their footprint.
 
## 06. Clarify Confusion
Brands must be clear, fighting confusion with clarity.

## 07. Convey Ideals
Brands must be symbolic, sewing harmony amongst diversity.
