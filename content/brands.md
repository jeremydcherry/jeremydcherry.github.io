#### Manifesto:

<span class="manifesto">A brand is only as good as the <em>human</em> endeavor it represents. Meaningful brands transmit value, dignify viewers, portray products and services authentically, reduce waste, clarify confusion, and resonate with our highest ideals.</span>

#### Tenets:

## Represent Humans
Brands must be ecological, reflecting the community they represent.

## Transmit Value
Brands must be useful, being both helpful and beautiful.

## Dignify Viewers
Brands must honor humans, providing meaning to their environment.

## Portray Authenticity
Brands must be honest, faithfully reflecting human aspirations.

## Reduce Waste
Brands must be responsible, being mindful of their footprint.
 
## Clarify Confusion
Brands must be clear, fighting confusion with clarity.

## Resonate Ideals
Brands must symbolize shared values, sewing harmony amongst diverse voices.
