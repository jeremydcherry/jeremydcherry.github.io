#### Manifesto:

<span class="manifesto">A brand is only as good as the <em>human</em> endeavor it represents. Meaningful brands transmit value, dignify viewers, portray products and services authentically, reduce waste, clarify confusion, and resonate with our highest ideals.</span>

#### Tenets:

## Represent Humans
Brands must be organic and ecological. They strive to reflect the community they represent.

## Transmit Value
Brands must transmit and translate value to their community. They strive to always be both useful and beautiful.

## Dignify Viewers
Brands must honor their community. They strive to provide meaning and shape to their environment.

## Portray Authenticity
Brands must be honest. They strive to foster trust by faithfully reflecting a communityâ€™s aspirations.

## Reduce Waste
Brands must be responsible and sustainable. They strive to reduce waste by being mindful of their footprint.
 
## Clarify Confusion
Brands must be clear. They strive to fight confusion with clarity and battle skepticism with hope.

## Resonate Ideals
Brands must symbolize the good we wish to embody. They strive to sew harmony in a community of unified voices.
