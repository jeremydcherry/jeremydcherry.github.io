I’ve had the distinct honor of writing about design ethics and theory over my career. My experience as a practicing designing has led me to cover a wide range of ideas and topics. I’ve captured the lengthier thoughts in longform. I’ve had the distinct honor of being published by hardworking folks like: Bootcamp, Creative Mornings, Communication Arts, Framer, Humane by Design, Medium, Modus, Sidebar, Smashing Magazine, Story Matters, UX Collective, and Web Designer News.

#### [Book](#book):

## _Designing Hope_

a book that explores creating compassionate work for humans. It defines a design framework that creates hope by practicing in an ecosystem, honoring that community with its solutions, and sharing in the responsibility of its outcomes. It’s equal parts manifesto and practical guide. It strives to rise above technical theory, seeking out practical compassion. In short, if you create things for others (you do), this book is for you.
