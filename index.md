#### About:

Relentlessly hopeful about the power of design, I live by the words “A better way is possible.” With over a decade of experience telling stories through brands, I have worked with clients from a wide variety of industries based all over the globe. I lead the Brand Studio at [Journey Group](https://journeygroup.com). I [write](https://jeremydcherry.medium.com/) and [speak](/speaking) about the intersection of design and ethics. Seeking to add hope back to the conversation, I wrote a book called [_Designing Hope_](https://hopeful.design) and penned a manifesto called [_Brands are Human_](/brandsarehuman).

#### Currently Spinning:

The only thing I love more than lists of _design_ links are lists of _music_ links. Whether it’s ranking my favorite music or diving into discographies, you may find something of interest below:

- [My Top Twenty-Five Records](/25)

- [My Top Five](/top-five)

- [My Mixes](/mixes)

- [The Discography Dive](/discography-dive)
