I'm Jeremy Cherry, a brand designer in Charlottesville, VA. Relentlessly hopeful about the power of design, I live by the words “A better way is possible.” With over a decade of experience telling stories through brands, I have worked with clients from a wide variety of industries based all over the globe. I lead the Brand Studio at [Journey Group](https://journeygroup.com). I write and [speak](/speaking) about the intersection of design and ethics. Seeking to add hope back to the conversation, I wrote a book called [_Designing Hope_](https://hopeful.design).
