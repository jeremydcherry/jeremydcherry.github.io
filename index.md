# Design with purpose

Relentlessly hopeful about the power of design, I live by the words “A better way is possible.” With over a decade of experience telling stories through brands, I have worked with clients from a wide variety of industries based all over the globe. I work at [Journey Group](https://journeygroup.com) in Charlottesville, VA. I write and speak about the intersection of design and ethics. Seeking to add hope back to the conversation, I wrote a book called [_Designing Hope_](https://hopeful.design).
